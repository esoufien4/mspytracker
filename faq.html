                    <h2>What is mSpy?</h2>
                    <p>mSpy is a leading parental control app for smartphones that allows parents to monitor text messages, calls, current GPS location, Snapchat, WhatsApp and much more. mSpy collects information from the target device and sends it to your <a href="https://demo2.mspy.com/">Control Panel</a> (your account that will be created after purchase) which you can access from any browser. mSpy for smartphones runs on Android 4+ rooted/not rooted and iOS 6 - 8.4; 9 - 9.1 jailbroken/non-jailbroken based platforms.</p> <p>User-friendly <a href="https://demo2.mspy.com">Customer’s area</a>, 24/7 live Customer Support, vast variety of subscription plans and affordable prices would make your experience the best value for your money.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ask-block" id="ask-2">
                    <h2>How does mSpy work?</h2>
                    <p>mSpy collects data from the device on which it is installed and displays it in the <a href="https://demo2.mspy.com/">Control Panel</a> which you can access using any Internet browser.</p> <p>To start using mSpy, you need to check the <a href="https://www.mspy.com/compatibility.html">compatibility</a> of the device you’d like to monitor, choose the subscription plan and proceed with the purchase. After that you receive an email with the login and password to your personal <a href="https://demo2.mspy.com/">Control Panel</a> where you also find the installation instructions. Basically you’ll need to have a full authorized physical access to the target device, launch the phone browser, type in the link for downloading the program and proceed with the installation. By installing mSpy, you confirm your intention to use this software legally, i.e. you install mSpy on your own device, the device of your underage child or the owner of the device agrees to be monitored.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ask-block" id="ask-3">
                    <h2>Does mSpy work worldwide?</h2>
                    <p>Our monitoring software works regardless of the cellular carrier network or the location of the target device and is compatible with all service providers (carriers). However, mSpy requires Internet connection to transfer data to your personal account (<a href="https://demo2.mspy.com">Control Panel</a> - your account that will be created after purchase), thus mobile Internet or Wi-Fi connection must be switched on the target device.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ask-block" id="ask-4">
                    <h2>What devices are supported by mSpy?</h2>
                    <p>mSpy is compatible with smartphones and tablets that run:</p> <ul> <li>Android 4+</li> <li>iOS 7 – 8.4; 9.0-9.1(WITH JAILBREAK)</li> <li>Compatible with all iOS versions(WITHOUT JAILBREAK)</li> </ul> <p>Please check whether your device is compatible by entering its model <a href="https://www.mspy.com/compatibility.html">here</a>.</p> <p>mSpy software also works on non-jailbroken iOS devices, though monitoring features may be limited with this solution option. (For a list of current features available with mSpy Without Jailbreak, click <a href="/no-jailbreak-spy.html">here</a>). To enjoy a full range of features, please purchase mSpy for jailbroken iOS devices.</p> <p>NOTE: mSpy and mSpy Without Jailbreak are the two separate solutions of the same elite monitoring product. You may freely switch between the two solutions, although in doing so, captured data logs will be lost.</p>

                    <h2>Is mSpy icon displayed on the monitored device?</h2>
                    <p>Right after the installation, mSpy application is launched and starts working in a background mode. The icon which appears after mSpy installation does not contain any settings for mSpy functionality. For better user experience, there are 2 options: either to keep it on the dashboard of the monitored device or not.</p> <p>By installing mSpy, you confirm your intention to use this software legally, i.e. you install mSpy on your own device, the device of your underage child or the owner of the device agrees to be monitored.</p>

                    <p>Using mSpy Without Jailbreak, you receive information within 24 hour since the latest back up has been done. Usually it takes that much time because backups can reach up to few gigabytes and it depends on Wi-Fi connection quality.</p><p>If you have mSpy on a jailbroken iPhone or Android, you can expect to receive updates based on the Update Interval you have selected. The Update Interval specifies how often mSpy is connected to our server and transfers information directly to your <a href="https://demo2.mspy.com">Control Panel</a>. When manually adjusting Update Interval from your account, please note that short update intervals (less than 10 min) may consume considerable battery life. Please, be informed that sometimes it can take up to 24 hours to receive all updates especially if the phone constantly uses 3G/4G connection which is not very stable and always depends on signal strength.</p>

                    <h2>My monitored device is an iPhone. Do I really need to jailbreak it to be able to install mSpy?</h2>
                    <p>Currently, mSpy offers monitoring software for both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices. If you do not wish to jailbreak the device, you may purchase mSpy Without Jailbreak. Note: The following features are available for mSpy Without Jailbreak subscriptions:</p><ul><li>Contacts</li><li>Call Logs</li><li><a href="../sms.html">Text Messages</a></li><li>Browser History</li><li>Events</li><li>Notes</li><li><a href="../whatsapp.html">WhatsApp</a></li><li>Wi-Fi Networks</li><li>Find my phone</li><li>Installed applications</li></ul><p>For access to mSpy’s full range of monitoring features, it is required that iOS device is jailbroken.</p>

                    <h2>Does jailbreak void warranty? Can I unjailbreak the target iDevice to restore warranty?</h2>
                    <p>While Jailbreak procedure voids device’s warranty, it is completely reversible. Updating to the latest iOS version or bringing phone back to factory settings will reverse the warranty. To keep mSpy fully operational on the target device, we would recommend to not update iOS version as it may affect jailbreak and mSpy installation.</p>

                    <h2>What happens after Jailbreak procedure?</h2>
                    <p>After Jailbreak procedure, the device will operate in the same mode as it used to, the user will be able to download media and applications from iTunes and use iCloud on a regular basis. Once Jailbreak is done an icon of Cydia will appear on the springboard of target device. For more information on how to remove Cydia icon, please check the corresponding article in our Help section from your <a href="https://demo2.mspy.com">Control Panel</a>. Jailbreaking procedure doesn’t affect phone’s performance and in many cases it even extends battery usage of the device.</p>

                    <h2>What is rooting? Do I need to root Android device to use mSpy? Does Android rooting void warranty?</h2>
                    <p>Rooting is the process of allowing users of smartphones and tablets running the Android operating system to attain privileged control (known as root access) within the Android’s subsystem. While the Rooting procedure voids device’s warranty, it is completely reversible. Rooting is required only if you need to monitor the non-default applications such as <a href="../whatsapp.html">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="../facebook.html">Facebook</a>, Viber, Skype, and Gmail (available only to Premium account holders).</p><p>If you are experiencing difficulties with an installation or having troubles with setting up the features, we’ll gladly perform initial installation of mSpy on your target mobile device with our special service <a href="/buynow.html">mAssistance</a>! We’ll complete Keylogger setup, Locations, disable SMS apps, and activate USB-debugging and more. We will also perform full Rooting procedure for you remotely. You’ll still need to have a physical access to the target device with an Internet connection.</p>

                    <h2>Why the mSpytracker phone tracker is the best spy app for you</h2>
                    <p>Most employees lie about what they do with company phones and other properties. As well as family and loved ones lying about their online activities. That is why you need a spy app to know if they are lying, cheating or revealing company secrets.</p> <p>More so, a phone tracker app will keep you abreast with what they (employees) actually use their paid work hours on.</p> <p>What’s more, a reliable cell phone tracker can protect kids not only online but also offline. With the ability to instantly see your target device’s current whereabouts on a detailed map and to check their route history over a specific period of time. You will always be aware of where they are at any given moment.</p> <p>The same applies to your employees, especially those who are often on the road. As a business owner, you have the full right to know how they are using their paid working hours!</p>
